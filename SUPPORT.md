go run ./cmd/umctl --addr http://localhost:8080 query examples
```

If the bug involves the Web UI, include:

## Feature Requests

Use the feature request template. Describe the user workflow, public interface impact, and why existing Query Service, CLI, MCP, or SDK surfaces are not enough.

## Commercial Or Private Deployment Support
